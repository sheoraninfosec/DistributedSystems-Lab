# 📡 Distributed Systems – Algorithms & Lab Experiments

Welcome to my Distributed Systems practice repository.
This repo contains implementations of core distributed system algorithms and university lab experiments, written in Python with a focus on clarity, correctness, and learning.

## 🎯 Goal: To build a strong foundation in distributed systems while maintaining a clean record of work that also serves as a portfolio for recruiters.

## 🛠 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```php
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/distributed-systems.git
cd distributed-systems
```

Run any algorithm (example – DVR):
```php
python3 algorithms/dvr_algorithm.py < input.txt
```

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

Understand the difference between centralized and distributed algorithms.

Implement algorithms without relying on external libraries, to grasp fundamentals.

Analyze time and message complexity of distributed protocols.

Build a portfolio of clean, working code to showcase to recruiters.
